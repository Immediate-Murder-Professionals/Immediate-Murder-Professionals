# Immediate-Murder-Professionals (I.M.P Headquarters, Imp City, Hell/Loona (receptionist and book keeper/Founder))
The company offers the unique service of eliminating living targets still on Earth as a form of settling the unfinished business of Hell's residents.

This is done through the use of Stolas's Grimoire that opens portals to Earth, allowing the assassins access to their human targets. It was founded by Blitzo and is run by him along with his employees, consisting of fellow Imps, such as Moxxie and Millie, as well as his Hellhound daughter, Loona.

While they do not accept contracts unless the targets are in the living world, they may accept special requests either if enough money is offered or they get to kill someone; an example of this is shown when Stolas hired them as bodyguards in order to safely visit Loo Loo Land with his daughter and they got to kill several would-be assassins targeting Stolas.
